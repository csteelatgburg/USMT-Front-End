# USMT-Front-End
GUI Front End for User State Migration Tool

This is a very simple front end that I built as a GUI tool for the Microsoft User State Migration Tool (USMT). 

When storing a user you must provide the domain for your environment. The default is set to the domain name for my institution (because I'm lazy).
