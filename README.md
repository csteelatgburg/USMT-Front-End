# USMT-Front-End
GUI Front End for User State Migration Tool

This is a very simple front end that I built as a GUI tool for the Microsoft User State Migration Tool (USMT). Once built the executable should be placed in the same folder as the USMT files obtained from the Microsoft Windows Automated Installation Kit.
